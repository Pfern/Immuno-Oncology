Large-scale bioinformatics for immuno-oncology 

Overview

The immuno-oncology approach leverages on the unique capability of the immune system to recognize and kill tumor cells. 
This action is hampered by escape mechanisms put in place by tumor cells, for instance, through the engagement immune checkpoints, 
inhibitory molecules that modulate the amplitude and duration of immune responses. Immunotherapies that block checkpoint molecules 
on immune cells are amongst the most promising approaches in immuno-oncology for the enhancement of antitumor immunity. 
Thanks to high-throughput technologies, such as next generation sequencing (NGS) and proteomics, we have now access to large-scale 
tumor data that can be used to investigate the interplay between tumor and immune cells and the role of the immune system in tumor 
progression and response to therapy. In this course, you will learn to use bioinformatics tools to extract from high-throughput tumor 
data the features describing this complex tumor-immune cell interface, such as: tumor antigens recognized by T cells, tumor-infiltrating 
immune cells, [... FE's methods...]

Methods

The course comprises practical exercises preceded by short lectures. Exercises will be conducted primarily in the R programming language.

Target Audiences

Motivated <molecular biologists, bioinformaticians, and students> [decide!] who want to gain an understanding of the bioinformatics 
tools that can be used to investigate the tumor-immune cell interface and eventually learn to extract immune-related features from 
their own high-throughput data.

Pre-requisites [expand]
•	Familiar with R (suggest resources?)
•	Basic UNIX skills (command line)
•	Basic knowledge of NGS (data format briefly explained, refer to other courses for data processing)
