Large-scale bioinformatics for immuno-oncology 


Overview

The immuno-oncology approach leverages on the unique capability of the immune system to recognize and kill tumor cells. 
This action is hampered by escape mechanisms put in place by tumor cells, for instance, through the engagement immune checkpoints, 
inhibitory molecules that modulate the amplitude and duration of immune responses. Immunotherapies that block checkpoint molecules 
on immune cells are amongst the most promising approaches in immuno-oncology for the enhancement of antitumor immunity. 
Thanks to high-throughput technologies, such as next generation sequencing (NGS) and proteomics, we have now access to large-scale 
tumor data that can be used to investigate the interplay between tumor and immune cells and the role of the immune system in tumor 
progression and response to therapy. In this course, you will learn to use bioinformatics tools and mathematical modeling to extract 
from high-throughput tumor data the features describing this complex tumor-immune cell interface, such as: tumor antigens recognized 
by T cells, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, and specific deregulations of the signalling pathway structure in cancer and immune cells.


Methods

The course comprises practical exercises preceded by short lectures. Exercises will be conducted primarily in the R programming language.


Target Audiences

Motivated molecular biologists, bioinformaticians, and students who want to gain an understanding of the bioinformatics tools and simple 
(logic-based) modeling approaches that can be used to investigate the signaling pathways of tumor and immune cells, as well as the
tumor-immune cell interface, and eventually learn to extract immune-related features from their own high-throughput data.


Pre-requisites 

Course participants should be familiar with R. Having basic UNIX skills can be an advantage, but is not mandatory. A brief introduction 
on NGS data format will be provided by the present course, whereas for an in depth introduction to standard NGS data analysis, we refer 
to the ELB17F and PM17 courses of the Gulbenkian Training Programme in Bioinformatics (http://gtpb.igc.gulbenkian.pt/bicourses/index.html).
