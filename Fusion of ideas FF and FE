Computational tools (+ web resources) to extract and interpret immunological features from tumor NGS data 
( http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v17/n8/full/nrg.2016.67.html ) 

Main themes: 

1. Prediction of tumor-specific antigens
  1a. Cancer-germline antigens
  1b. Neoantigens
2. Characterization of tumor-infiltrating immune cells

Methods:

1a. easy computation
1b. pipeline assembly:
  - HLAtyping
  - prediction of mutated proteins and peptides
  - prediction of peptides binding to HLA molecules
  - (selection of expressed peptides)

2. deconvolution of expression data with
  - CIBERSORT: https://cibersort.stanford.edu/ 
  or
  - CellMix: https://web.cbio.uct.ac.za/~renaud/CRAN/web/CellMix

My expertise is on dynamic models of signaling pathways (in particular logic models) applied to investigate (de)regulation of signal transduction in cancer and the use of these approaches for personalised therapy. In my research I mainly focus on the investigation of signaling pathways in cancer cells and the effect of targeted kinase inhibitors (e.g. aimed at suggesting personalised combinatorial therapies), but the same approaches can be useful also to study cancer immunology. 

Here below a list of topics I could cover:
- Introduction about the importance of signaling pathways in the context of tumor immunology: immune pathway, checkpoint blockade, cancer pathways and tumor escape mechanisms to immune system 

-  Overview of proteomics data that can be used to investigate signaling pathway dynamics and their specific advantages and limitations (number of measurable proteins versus number of samples/perturbed conditions). I could include here standard technologies (e.g. Reverse Phase Protein Arrays, Mass Spectrometry, xMAP) as well as a novel microfluidics technology we recently developed for functional screening of patient samples (http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/14/093906 <http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/14/093906>).

- Overview of quantitative and qualitative modeling approaches. I would then focus on logic modeling and in particular on the software CellNOpt (http://www.cellnopt.org/ <http://www.cellnopt.org/>) developed in Julio Saez-Rodriguez group (where I have been working as a postdoc over the last 4 years). Here (link <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44667927/ICSB_course_FE.key>) some slides I presented at a satellite meeting of the ICSB 2016 conference ("Hands-on tutorial on software tools for logical modeling"), part of the slides are curtsey of Julio Saez-Rodriguez, and the course also included practical exercises.

- Optionally I could include also an overview other bioinformatics tools which can be applied for network analysis and modeling (e.g. Cytoscape, BioModels database, GINsim, MaBoss), maybe with some practical example applied to investigation of immune pathway.
