List of the main Learning Objectives LO (Temporarily split by topic), followed by specific learning outcomes

------------------------------------------------

TUMOR-INFILTRATING IMMUNE CELLS


LO 1. Have an overview of the immune cells infiltrating human tumors
      - Describe the cancer-immunity cycle and list the main immune cell types involved in antitumor immunity 
      - List the differente types of immune cells present in the tumor microenvironment, their pro- or anti-tumorigenic role, and their prognostic/predictive value

LO 2.  Understand the computational approaches available to investigate tumor-infiltrating immune cells from expression data
      - Explain the methodology behind the computational approaches for the quantification of tumor-infiltrating immune cells
      - Summarize the differences between GSEA and deconvolution approaches
      - List the main methods for expression-data deconvolution and discuss their differences in terms of target cell types and mathematical approach

LO 3.  Select and prepare NGS expression data for analysis
      - Illustrate the different types of RNA-seq expression data: e.g. raw counts, RPKM, FPKM, TPM, counts, other library scaling approaches.
      - Annotate expression data using updated gene symbols to avoid data loss
      - Avoide possible "Excel conversion issues"
      - Explain the effect of normalization (e.g. TPM or log-scale) on gene ranking and expression

LO 4. Analyze NGS expression data to quantify tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and other immune cell types
      - Estimate immune cell fractions from colorectal cancer (CRC) NGS data using DeconRNA-seq in R
      - Compute TIL scores using ESTIMATE in R

LO 5. Understand the results and their relevance for immunotherapy with checkpoint blockers
      - Visualize cell fractions as boxplots and compare them between different CRC subtypes
      - Discuss the possible consequences for immunotherapy

LO 6. Benchmarck deconvolution results and identify possible pitfalls in the analysis
      - List alternative experimental methodologies for the quantification of tumor-infiltrating immune cells that can be used to benchmark deconvolution results
      - Use Pearson's correlation and RMSE to quantitatively assess deconvolution performance
      - Troubleshoot deconvolution results (e.g. missing signature genes, normalization, collinearity)
