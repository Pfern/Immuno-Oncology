__________________________________________________________________

Lecture:
  - Immune cells and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes: types, functional orientation, and relevance for cancer
  - Estimating tumor infiltrating immune cells from expression data: GSEA, deconvolution, ESTIMATE,...
  - Example algorithms for deconvolution: how do they work in practice?

# Ex. A1 (slides): deconvolution of RNA-seq data with a web-service
# Data: Hoek et. al, 2015?
# Method: CIBERSORT web-service
  - Understanding input data: introduction to LM22 signature matrix and immune cell-types
  - Possible data issues: overlap mixture/signature genes, annotation, Excel format issues, data format
  - Running the analysis: options
  - Understanding the results: output data format

__________________________________________________________________

Lectures: 
  - The tumor-immunity cycle and the anticancer immune response
