  A. TUMOR IMMUNE INFILTRATES
__________________________________________________________________

Lecture:
  - Immune cells and TILs (+ relevance)
  - GSEA and deconvolution (+ math)
  - DeconRNA-seq and ESTIMATE algorithms
  - NGS expression data: TPM, counts, RPKM, FPKM

# Ex. A1 (slides): deconvolution of PBMCs with CIBERSORT web service
  - presents LM22 and immune cell types
  - show codes
  - discuss overlap mixture/signature genes, re-annotation(?), excel format issues(?) 
  - discuss results (fractions, not for all tools)
  - share deconvolution results
  
# Ex. A2 (hands on): run deconvolution on R (LM22 + DeconRNAseq?)
  - natural and log-scale
  - benchmarking with flow cytometry: r and RMSE
  - assess results (vs. flow cytometry and CIBERSORT), differences due to algorithm?
  
 # Ex. A3 (hands on): run deconvolution on R (LM22 + DeconRNAseq?) on TCGA data 
  - CRC
  - differences between groups (MSS vs. MSI)
 
 # Ex. A4 (hands on): quantify tumor infiltrating lymphocytes from TCGA data in R with ESTIMATE
  - CRC
  - analysis of counts, no TPM (imp. normalization and ranking, GSEA-based)
  - differences between groups

  B. TUMOR ANTIGENS
__________________________________________________________________

Lecture: 
  - Tumor-immunity cycle and anticancer immune response
  - Types of tumor antigens
  - Pipeline for neoantigens (also expression filtering)
  - Mutation data types (VCF, VEP)
  - RNA-seq/Sequence data types (FASTQ, FASA)
  
# Ex. B1 (hands on): cancer-germline antigens [Maybeâ€¦]
 - Use CRC data and gene lists from CTdtabase (heat map?)

# Ex. B2 (slides): VEP website
 - single-sample data (selected mutations) 
 - discuss plugins and options (mutated proteins, Condel score, etc.)
 - discuss extraction mutated peptides

# Ex. B3 (hands on): Run Optitype from command line
 - Use small files to run Optitype fast

# Ex. B4 (hands on): Run NetMHCpan from website
 - use data from examples above

# Ex. B5 (hans on, if possible): Run full pipeline
 - Run full pipeline on real single-sample data (Hugo?): HLA, mutated proteins, binding peptides, filtering
