  A. TUMOR IMMUNE INFILTRATES
__________________________________________________________________

Lecture:
  - Immune cells and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes: types, functional orientation, and relevance for cancer
  - Estimating tumor infiltrating immune cells from expression data: GSEA, deconvolution, ESTIMATE,...
  - Example algorithms for deconvolution: how do they work in practice?
  - Brief introduction on NGS expression data (i.e. RNA-seq): TPM, counts, RPKM, FPKM

# Ex. A1 (slides): deconvolution of RNA-seq data with a web-service
# Data: Hoek et. al, 2015?
# Method: CIBERSORT web-service
  - Understanding input data: introduction to LM22 signature matrix and immune cell-types
  - Possible data issues: overlap mixture/signature genes, annotation, Excel format issues, data format
  - Running the analysis: options
  - Understanding the results: output data format

__________________________________________________________________

Lectures: 
  - The tumor-immunity cycle and the anticancer immune response
  - The different steps of antigen processing and presentations  
  - The different types of tumor antigens and their specificity

# Ex. B1 (hands-on): quantification of cancer-germline-antigen expression from tumor RNA-seq data [ Maybe… ]
# Data: TCGA CRC
# Method: heatmap, CTdtabase, databases for normal tissues
