  A. TUMOR IMMUNE INFILTRATES
__________________________________________________________________

Lecture:
  - Immune cells and TILs (+ relevance)
  - GSEA and deconvolution (+ math)
  - NGS expression data: TPM, counts, RPKM, FPKM

# Ex. A1 (slides): deconvolution of PBMCs with CIBERSORT web service
  - presents LM22 and immune cell types
  - show codes
  - discuss overlap mixture/signature genes, re-annotation(?), excel format issues(?) 
  - discuss results (fractions, not for all tools)
  - share deconvolution results
  
# Ex. A2 (hands on): run deconvolution on R (LM22 + DeconRNAseq?)
  - re-annotation with provided map(?)
  - benchmarking with flow cytometry: r and RMSE
  - assess results qualitatively (performance on correlted cell types)
  - assess results quantitatively (vs. flow cytometry and CIBERSORT), reasons in the algorithm?
  
 # Ex. A3 (hands on): run deconvolution on R (LM22 + DeconRNAseq?) on TCGA data 
  - CRC
  - qualitative assessment
  - impact of normalization (OK in CIBERSORT)
  - differences bewteen groups (MSS vs. MSI)
 
 # Ex. A4 (hands on): quantify tumor infiltrating lymphocytes from TCGA data in R with ESTIMATE
  - CRC
  - analysis of counts, no TPM (imp. normalization and ranking, GSEA-based)
  - differences between groups
