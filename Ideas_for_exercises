  A. TUMOR IMMUNE INFILTRATES
__________________________________________________________________

Lecture:
  - Introduction on immune cells and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes: types and relevance for cancer
  - Estimating tumor infiltrating immune cells from expression data: GSEA and deconvolution (also ESTIMATE)
  - Example algorithms: how do they work in practice?
  - Brief introduction on NGS expression data (i.e. RNA-seq): TPM, counts, RPKM, FPKM

# Ex. A1 (slides): deconvolution of RNA-seq data with a web server
# Data: Hoek et. al, 2015?
# Method: CIBERSORT web-service
  - Understanding input data: introduction to LM22 signature matrix and immune cell-types
  - Understanding input data: overlap mixture/signature genes, annotation, Excel format issues, data format
  - Running the analysis: present options
  - Understanding the results: output data format
